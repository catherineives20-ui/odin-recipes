First Foundation Course Project Recipes

This project is my first project building a website. I got a glimpse into HTML 
and it's made me realise how far I have to go in learning semantic HTML. It's
not clear what the best practice is, while it has also highlighted the importance
of small git commits with good commit messages. When I made too many small changes
writing a good commit message became more difficult. Lastly, It's made me realise
how many iterations is needed to get a finished product, I had this idea that it
should be a finished product first time round, that developers just design a 
website on their first attempt without iterations. This provides perspective and
feels better when your making small changes and improving at least 1%.
